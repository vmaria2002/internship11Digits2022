            <p class="cardtext2 lines">Fantastic! D&P advertised 110 MBPS download. I am getting - through
              my router 107 MBPS. Upload speed is 23 MBPS. Can't argue with that can you? Compare to Frontier DSL
              which was 3.5 MBPS download (they promised 10 I think) and 0.25 MBPS upload. Pathetic! They started out
              with at about 8.5 MBPS and then after a couple weeks I was lucky to hit 4 MBPS! This was after they
              begged for me to stay with them! Well finally I switched. I wish I would have done it sooner! D&P came
              out, installed the equipment quickly an efficiently. The installer was knowledgeable and professional.
              They arrived around the time they said they would - a little earlier actually. I'm so happy! I'll update
